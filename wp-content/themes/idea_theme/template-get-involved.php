							<h2 class="get-in-h2">COACHES</h2>
							<p class="get-in-p">IDEA coaches are dedicated graduate and undergraduate students that work directly with our ventures, bringing them through our stage-gate process. Coaches work as consultants by helping ventures complete their Business Plan, develop their business model, and put them on track to becoming a self-sustaining or investment ready enterprise. Coaches are a critical component of the IDEA program as they are the bridge between the venture and all of IDEA’s resources, service providers, workshops, and funding opportunities, both inside and outside of IDEA.</p>

Mentors are seasoned business men/women who are immersed in the entrepreneurial/business ecosystem and can provide suggestions for the myriad of challenges all startups face. While coaches are paired directly with ventures for the duration, Mentors provide help to many different ventures who call for their expertise. </p>

From law and accounting firms to software platforms and backend support, these supporters have agreements with IDEA to offer in-kind services and discounts to ventures that likely cannot afford them yet to help them grow and become successful.</p>
